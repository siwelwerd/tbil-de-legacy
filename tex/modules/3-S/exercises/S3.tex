Consider the dual mass-spring system at the right.  Both masses are \(1 {\rm kg}\).  The upper spring has a spring constant of \( 1 {\rm N/m}\) while the lower spring constant is \(6 {\rm N/m}\).  The lower mass is pulled down \(1 {\rm m}\) without disturbing the upper mass, and released from rest. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Write down an IVP modelling the motion of the two masses.
\item Where will the two masses be after \(2 {\rm s}\)?
