\item Suppose you know that every vector in \(\IR^5\) can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors \(\{\vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_n\}\).  What can you conclude about the set \(\{\vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_n\}\)?

\item It does not span and is linearly independent
\item It is a basis of \(\IR^5\).
\item It spans but it is linearly dependent
