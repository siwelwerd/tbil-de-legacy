\begin{problem}{C1}
Set up and solve a differential equation to answer the following question: \\
A water droplet with a radius of \(100\ {\rm \mu m}\) has a mass of about \(4 \times 10^{-12} {\rm kg}\) and a terminal velocity of \(27\ {\rm \frac{cm}{s}}\).  Such a droplet is dropped from rest.  What is its velocity after \(0.01\ {\rm s}\)?
