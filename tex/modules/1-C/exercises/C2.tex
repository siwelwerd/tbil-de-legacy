\begin{problem}{C2}
A water droplet with a radius of \(100\ {\rm \mu m}\) has a mass of about \(4 \times 10^{-12} {\rm kg}\) and a terminal velocity of \(27\ {\rm \frac{cm}{s}}\).  Such a droplet is dropped from rest.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Write down an IVP modelling the velocity.
\item What is its velocity after \(0.01\ {\rm s}\)?
