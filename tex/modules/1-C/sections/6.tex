\begin{applicationActivities}
\begin{activity}{20}
A \(3\rm kg\) mass is attached to a spring requires \(4\) Newtons (\(\rm kg\cdot m/s^2\)) to
pull the mass \(2\) meters from its natural length. No damper is applied. The mass
is then released from rest.
\begin{subactivity}
Adapt the ODE \[my''+by'+ky=0\] to give an initial value problem modeling this scenario.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
How much time will pass before the spring first returns to its natural length?
