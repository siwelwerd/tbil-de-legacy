Why don't clouds fall out of the sky?
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{media/cloud.jpg}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item They are lighter than air
\item Wind keeps them from falling
\item Electorstatic charge
\item They do fall, just very slowly
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}
List all of the forces acting on a tiny droplet of water falling from the sky.
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}
Tiny droplets of water obey \term{Stoke's law}, which says that air resistance is proportional to (the magnitude of) velocity.
Let \(v\) be the velocity of a droplet of water (positive for upward, negative for downward).
Let \(g>0\) be the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity and \(b>0\) be another positive constant.
Assume that the only forces acting on a falling droplet of water are gravity and air resistance.
\\~\\
Apply Newton's second law (force \(=\) mass \(\times\) acceleration) 
to determine which of the following
\term{ordinary differential equations (ODEs)} models the velocity of a falling droplet of water. 
\vfill
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(v'=g-v\)
\item \(v'=g+v\)
\item \(mv'=-mg-bv\)
\item \(mv'=-mg+bv\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
The modeling equation
\[mv'=-mg-bv\]
may be obtained by splitting the total force into gravity and air resistance:
\[F=F_g+F_r\]

Then \(F=ma=mv'\) and \(F_g=m(-g)=-mg\) are the result of Newton's second law,
and \(F_r=-bv\) holds because it should be (a) in the opposite direction of velocity 
and (b) a constant multiple of velocity.

\vfill

Note that this equation may be rearranged as follows to group \(v\)
and its derivative \(v'\) together on the left-hand side:

\[v'+\left(\frac{b}{m}\right)v=-g\]
\end{observation}

\begin{definition}
A \term{first order constant coefficient} differential equation can be written in the form
\[y^\prime+by=f(x),\]
or equivalently,
\[\frac{dy}{dx} +by=f(x).\]
We will use both notations interchangeably.

Here, \term{first order} refers to the fact that the highest derivative we see is the first derivative of \(y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{observation}
Consider the differential equation \(y'=y\).

A useful way to visualize a first order differential equation is by a \term{slope field}


\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        domain=-3:3,
        view={0}{90},
        axis background/.style={fill=white},
    ]
        \addplot3[black,
            quiver={
             u={1/(sqrt(1 + (y)^2))},
             v={(y)/(sqrt(1 + (y)^2))},
             scale arrows=0.2,
            },
            -stealth,samples=15]
                {exp(-x) - 1/2*sin(x) - 1/2*cos(x)};

\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
Each arrow represents the slope of a solution \term{trajectory} through that point.
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{5}
Consider the differential equation \(y'=y\) with slope field below.

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        domain=-3:3,
        view={0}{90},
        axis background/.style={fill=white},

             v={(y)/(sqrt(1 + (y)^2))},
             scale arrows=0.2,
            },
            -stealth,samples=15]
                {exp(-x) - 1/2*sin(x) - 1/2*cos(x)};

\begin{activity}{15}
Consider the differential equation \(y^\prime=y\).
\begin{subactivity}
Find a solution to \(y^{\prime}=y\).
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Modify this solution to write an expression describing \textbf{all} solutions to \(y^{\prime}=y\).
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{definition}
A differential equation will have many solutions.
Each individual solution is said to be a \term{particular solution},
while the \term{general solution} encompasses all of these by using 
parameters such as \(C,k,c_0,c_1\) and so on. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item The general solution to the differential equation \(y'=2x-3\) is \(y=x^2-3x+C\) (as done in
Calculus courses).
\item The general solution for \(y'=y\) is \(y=ke^x\) (as done in the previous activity). 
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}


\begin{activity}{15}
Adapt the general solution \(y=ke^x\) for \(y^\prime=y\) to find general solutions for
the following differential equations.
\begin{subactivity}

\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Solve \(y^{\prime}=y+2\).
\end{subactivity}
