\begin{observation}
Consider the homogeneous second order constant coefficient ODE \[ay''+by'+cy=0.\]
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item If \(r\) is a root of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), then \(e^{rt}\) is a solution of the ODE.
\item If \(r\) is a double root, variation of parameters shows that \(te^{rt}\) is also a solution.
\item if \(r\) is not real, Euler's formula allows us to express the solution in terms of \(\sin(rt)\) and \(\cos(rt)\).
\end{itemize}
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{15}
Consider a mass of \(4\ {\rm kg}\) suspended from a damped spring with spring constant \(k=2\ {\rm kg/s^2}\) and damping constant \(b= 6\ {\rm kg/s}\).  
\vfill
The mass is pulled down \(0.3\ {\rm m}\) and released from rest.  How many times does it pass back through its equillibrium state?
\vfill
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(0\)
\item \(1\)
\item \(2\)
\item Infinitely many
\end{enumerate}

Consider a mass of \(5\ {\rm kg}\) suspended from a damped spring with spring constant \(k=2\ {\rm kg/s^2}\) and damping constant \(b= 6{\rm kg/s}\).  
\vfill
The mass is pulled down \(0.3 {\rm m}\) and released from rest.  How many times does it pass back through its equillibrium state?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(0\)
\item \(1\)
\item \(2\)
\item Infinitely many
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
It can be shown that in the \term{overdamped} situation, the spring might pass through the equillibrium position once (e.g. if given an initial push), but never more than once.
