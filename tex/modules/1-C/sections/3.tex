\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{5}
More abstractly, let's attach a mass (weighing \(m\ {\rm kg}\)) to a spring.

\begin{center}
\springmass
\end{center}
\vfill
List all forces acting on the mass.
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}
\term{Hooke's law} says that the force exerted by the spring is proportional to the distance the spring is stretched.

\begin{center}
\springmass
\end{center}
\vfill
Write a differential equation modeling the displacement of the mass.
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
There is an equillibrium point where the force of gravity balances the spring force.  If we measure displacement from this point, we can model the mass-spring system by
\[my''=ky.\]
\vfill
\begin{center}
\springmass
\end{center}
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{15}
Consider the (numerically simplified) mass-spring equation \[y''=-y.\]
\begin{subactivity}
Find a solution.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Find the general solution.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Describe the long term behavior of the mass-spring system.
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}
In applications, this infinitely oscillating behavior is often inappropriate.
\vfill
Thus, a damper (dashpot) is often incorporated.  This provides a force proportional to the velocity.
\begin{center}
\springmassdamper
\end{center}
\vfill
Write a differential equation modeling the displacement of a mass in a \textbf{damped} mass-spring system.
\vfill
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
The damped mass-spring system can be modelled by
\[my''=-by'-ky.\]
Here \(m\) is the mass, \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(b\) is the damping constant.  We can rearrange this as
\[my''+by'+ky=0.\]
\vfill
This is a  \term{homogeneous second order constant coefficient} differential equation.
Here, \term{homogeneous} refers to the \(0\) on the right hand side of the equation.
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{15}

\begin{subactivity}
Find a solution.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Find the general solution.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Describe the long term behavior of the solutions.
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
It is sometimes useful to think in terms of \term{differential  operators}.
\begin{itemize}
\item We will use \(D\) to represent a derivative; another common notation is \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\).  So for any function \(y\),  \[D(y)=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=y'.\]
\item \(D^2\) will denote the second derivative operator (i.e. differentiate twice, or apply D twice).
\item We will use \(I\) for the identity operator; it does nothing to a function.  That is, \(I(y)=y\).  It can be thought of as \(I=D^0\) (i.e. differentiate zero times).
\end{itemize}
\vfill
In this language, the differential equation \(y'+3y=0\) can be rewritten as \(D(y)+3I(y)=0\), or \( (D+3I)(y)=0\).
\vfill
Thus, the question of solving the homogeneous differential equation is the question of finding the \term{kernel} of the differential operator \(D+3I\).
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{5}
What is the kernel of \(D-I\) ?
\vfill
\begin{subactivity}
Write a differential equation that corresponds to this question.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}

\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}

\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{10}
Consider the ODE \[y''+5y+6y=0.\]
\vfill
\begin{subactivity}
Find a differential operator whose kernel is the solution set of the above ODE.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Factor this differential operator as a composition of two operators. (This works because \(D\) and \(I\) commute).
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Find the general solution of the ODE.
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
If we let \(\L=D^2+5D+6I\), we can write the ODE \[y''+5y+6y=0\] as \[\L(y)=0.\]

Note that such an \(\L\) is always a \term{linear transformation}.
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{10}
Consider the ODE \[y''+5y-6y=0.\]
\vfill
\begin{subactivity}
Find a differential operator whose kernel is the solution set of the above ODE.
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Factor this differential operator as a composition of two operators. (This works because \(D\) and \(I\) commute).
\end{subactivity}

\vfill
\begin{subactivity}

\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Describe the long-term behavior of the solutions.
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}


\begin{activity}{10}
Solve the ODE \[ y''-4y'+4y=0.\]
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
To solve this, we need to find the kernel of \( (D-2I)(D-2I) \).
\begin{itemize}
\item The kernel of \(D-2I\) is \(\left\{ ce^{2t}\ \middle|\ c \in \IR \right\}\).
\item However, if \( (D-2I)(y) = Ae^{2t} \), then applying \(D-2I\) twice will yield zero!
\item So we must solve the ODE \[y'-2y=e^{2t}.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{15}
Solve \(y'-2y=e^{2t}\).
\end{activity}


\begin{observation}
Thus, we have shown that the general solution of \[y''-4y'+4y=0\] is \[y=c_0e^{2t}+c_1te^{2t}.\]
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{15}
Solve \(y''-6y'+9y=0\).
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{10}
Consider the homogeneous second order constant coefficient ODE \[ay''+by'+cy=0.\]
If \(r\) is a number such that \(ar^2+br+c=0\), what can you conclude?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(e^{rt}\) is a solution.
\item \(e^{-rt}\) is a solution.
\item \(te^{rt}\) is a solution.
\item There are no solutions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{5}
Consider the homogeneous second order constant coefficient ODE \[ay''+by'+cy=0.\]

When does the general solution have the form \(c_0 e^{rt}+te^{rt}\) ?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item When the polynomial \(ax^2+bx+c\) has two distinct real roots.
\item When the polynomial \(ax^2+bx+c\) has a repeated real root.
\item When the polynomial \(ax^2+bx+c\) has two distinct non-real roots.
\item When the polynomial \(ax^2+bx+c\) has a repeated non-real root.
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}


\begin{observation}
Consider the homogeneous second order constant coefficient ODE \[ay''+by'+cy=0.\]
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item If \(r\) is a root of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), then \(e^{rt}\) is a solution of the ODE.
\item If \(r\) is a double root, variation of parameters shows that \(te^{rt}\) is also a solution.
\item if \(r\) is not real, Euler's formula allows us to express the solution in terms of \(\sin(rt)\) and \(\cos(rt)\).
\end{itemize}
