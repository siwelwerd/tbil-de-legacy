\begin{observation}
Let \(T: V \rightarrow W\).  We have previously defined the following
terms.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \(T\) is called \term{injective} or \term{one-to-one} if \(T\) always maps  distinct vectors to different places.
\item \(T\) is called \term{surjective} or \term{onto} if every element of \(W\) is mapped to by some element of \(V\).
\item The \term{kernel} of \(T\) is the set of all vectors in \(V\) that are mapped to \(\vec{z}\in W\).  It is a subspace of \(V\).
\item The \term{image} of \(T\) is the set of all vectors in \(W\) that are mapped to by something in \(V\).  It is a subspace of \(W\).
\end{itemize}
\end{observation}

Let \(T: V \rightarrow W\) be a linear transformation where
\(\ker T\) contains multiple vectors. What can you conclude?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(T\) is injective
\item \(T\) is not injective
\item \(T\) is surjective
\item \(T\) is not surjective
\end{enumerate}
