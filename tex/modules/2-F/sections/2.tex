In Module C, we discussed that tiny spherical objects like droplets of water obey Stoke's law: drag is proportional to velocity (speed).  But for larger objects, a better model incorporates \term{quadratic drag}, i.e. drag is proportional to the square of velocity.
\vfill
Which of the following ODEs models the velocity of a falling object subject to quadratic drag?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(mv'=-mg+bv\)
\item \(mv'=-mg-bv\)
\item \(mv'=-mg+bv^2\)
\item \(mv'=-mg-bv^2\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}{10}
Consider our model of a falling object under quadratic drag \[mv'=-mg+bv^2.\]

\begin{subactivity}
For what value of \(v\) will the change in velocity be \(0\)?
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Suppose the object is currently falling at a rate slower than this speed.  What will happen?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item It will slow down
\item It will keep falling at the same speed.
\item It will speed up
\end{enumerate}
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
This equillibrium speed is called the \term{terminal velocity}.
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{5}
Consider the following question:
\vfill
A penny is dropped off the top of the Empire State Building.  How fast will it be going when it hits the ground?
\vfill
What information do we need to answer this question?
\end{activity}

\begin{observation}
The mass of a penny is \(2.5 {\rm g}\).  The Empire State Building is (roughly) \(400 {\rm m}\) tall.
\vfill
The terminal velocity of a penny is about \(25 {\rm m/s}\).
\end{observation}

\begin{activity}{20}
We calculated earlier that the terminal velocity is \(v_t = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{b}}\).  
\begin{subactivity}
Solve for \(b\) in terms of \(v_t,m,g\), and substitute this in to our model \(v'=-g+\frac{b}{m}v^2\).
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
Solve this separable ODE \\
\textbf{Hint:} \(\frac{1}{v_t^2-v^2}=\frac{1}{2v_t}\left(\frac{1}{v_t-v}+\frac{1}{v_t+v}\right)\)
\end{subactivity}
\begin{subactivity}
How fast is the penny going after 10 seconds?
\end{subactivity}
\end{activity}
